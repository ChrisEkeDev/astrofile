              the sun on the day you were born. Take a look below to learn what

              The dynamic vibrations of the Numerology numbers have a profound
              effect on our lives. With so much energy surrounding us, it can be
              easy to take their influence for granted. How does Numerology
              impact you, specifically? Your Numerology chart contains key
              insight that can be used to reveal your life purpose and destiny,
              as well as forecast your future.

              The Planets, the sun, the moon, the two luminaries, as well as the
              eight planets in our solar system are the most important component
              when it comes to understanding how astrology works. Sun - Planet
              of Self, Moon - Planet of Emotions, Mercury - Planet of
              Communication, Venus - Planet of Love & Money, Mars - Planet of
              Passion, Jupiter - Planet of Luck, Saturn - Planet of Karma,
              Uranus - Planet of Rebellion, Neptune - Planet of Illusion, and
              Pluto - Planet of Power.

              The following free birth chart tool lists planet signs, house
              positions, and aspects. It also allows you to compare multiple
              house systems. (The default house system is Placidus). You will
              only find some interpretations right now (many of the major
              factors, such as Sun, Moon, Ascendant, Mercury, and Venus in signs
              and house), but I am working on adding more interpretations
              frequently, so please check back here from time to time! The
              interpretations in the following birth chart report are written by
              myself, Annie Heese, and are typically expanded interpretations
              already found on this site.

              There are 78 Tarot cards in a complete deck. The first 22 are
              called the Major Arcana Tarot cards. The remaining 56 Minor Arcana
              cards are divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and
              Pentacles. Each suit contains 14 cards, including 10 numbered
              cards plus a Page, Knight, Queen, and King. How do you read Tarot
              cards?
