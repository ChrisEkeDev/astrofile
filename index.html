          Since the earliest days of our civilizations we have observed the
          Heavens to gain a greater understanding of the relationship between
          humanity and the universe. Too early humans the impermanence of
          existence on Earth brought uncertainty. The recurrence of celestial
          phenomena, however, such as the rising and setting sun, in contrast
          brought reassurance. Our ancestors perceived this contrast as the
          fundamental distinction between Celestial and terrestrial domains.
          Astrology is, therefore, a study of the meaningful interaction between
          the stars, planetary cycles, and events on Earth. <br /><br />
          Astrology maintains that the course of nature is a circle or mandala.
          In the 360Â° of the circle we experience each moment of being
          individually and collectively. Each degree is a separate fragment of
          the circle, but only with each degree present does the circle exist.
          The mandala is a symbol of all creation, a self-contained and perfect
          form with no beginning, no end. The circle stands for both the
          universe and all human individuals, for the universe within. All of
          life's activities relate to this circle. It's structure also conveys
          the cycles of time. By exploring astrology, one can reveal the
          connections between the external and internal universes, gaining
          greater psychological and spiritual awareness.<br /><br />
          One of the few remaining philosophies to maintain a holistic
          perspective, astrology teaches us that everything is interconnected.
          Nothing stands as a law by itself. Everything is part of a constantly
          shifting and dynamic relationship with the cycles of the cosmos. We do
          not stand outside this living system. We affected, and we are
          profoundly affected by it. All people are part of a changing and
          dynamic relationship with other people. The universe is a complex
          interplay of cycles and forces, as opposite polarities set each other
          in motion, themselves part of a greater systems. Astrologers
          acknowledge this interplay and try to comprehend it through symbolism.

          <h2>The Signs</h2>
          <p>
            Astrology maintains that we are all born into life to join this
            great cycle of existence in order to take on a role within the
            divine drama. In astrology, all twelve signs are imbedded in the
            psyches of individuals and humankind alike. Each zodiac signs takes
            on and acts the roles of particular archetype in order to manifest
            its own power in the act of creation.

          <h2>The Numbers</h2>
          <p>
            The belief that numbers possess sacred powers has been shared not
            just by the archaic cultures and Greek philosophers, but also by
            Renaissance scholars and may present-day mathematicians. Numbers
            possess a dual nature and can represent either a positive or
            negative force. Exploring their meanings can help us discover and
            develop our personal potential and guide us on a life's journey.

          <h2>The Planets</h2>
          <p>
            Each of the planets represents a psychological function and
            corresponds to aspects of our personality. Character traits are
            suggested by the positions of the planets and the relationship they
            have to each other. In astrology, the Sun and Moon, technically
            named the luminaries, are included in the ten planets that make up
            our solar system.
